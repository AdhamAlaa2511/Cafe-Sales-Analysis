# ☕ Cafe Sales Analysis Dashboard

### 📊 Project Overview
This project is part of my Data Analysis learning journey — a continuation after completing a data analysis course.  
The main goal is to analyze and visualize real-world sales data from a simulated **Cafe dataset**.

---

### 🧹 Data Cleaning (Python)
- Used **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** for data cleaning and transformation.
- Handled missing and null values using appropriate methods (median/mode).
- Converted data types (object → numeric/date).
- Created new calculated columns such as Total Spent and Revenue Category.
- Stored the cleaned dataset for use in Power BI.
